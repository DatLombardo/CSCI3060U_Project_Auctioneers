 Michael Lombardo, Joseph Robertson, Michael Setnyk

 This program is the backend for an auction house system.
 A merged transaction file, user file and items file (in that order)
 are all sent in as arguments to the auction house system
 The system applies changes made to the user and items files
 Changes are specifed in the transaction file.  All changes are
 recorded in the system when a login transaction is read in.
 Changes are official when a logout transaction is read.
 If a user is deleted before they make any transactions then those
 transactions will never exist.
